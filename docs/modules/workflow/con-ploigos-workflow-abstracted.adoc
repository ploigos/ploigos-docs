_What is Ploigos?_

Ploigos is an opinionated workflow used to transform ideas into delivered 
software in a production environment. Ploigos can be divided into two major 
components: the Idea Delivery Workflow and the CI/CD Workflow.

The Idea Delivery Workflow is an abstract process workflow that defines a 
high level view of how an organization can best take ideas that solve business 
problems and implement the solution in a well defined procedure. This process 
focuses on the specific actions that need to take place without identifying 
specific tools for each step. Ploigos provides a general use Idea Delivery 
Workflow that can be further customized to fit specific projects as needed. A 
workflow first approach identifies the organizational behaviors and expected 
outcomes to define what quality is. The workflow codifies and enforces 
these to ensure all aspects of security, compliance, trust, and privacy 
are addressed.

The CI/CD Workflow is the implementation of the software development portion 
of the Idea Delivery Workflow. Ploigos creates a framework for a modular, 
extensible, and opinionated CD/CD pipeline. Modularity and extensibility are 
accomplished by defining one or more '*Steps*' in the CD/CD workflow, and 
automating the *Step* by creating a *StepImplementer*. As part of fulfilling 
the opinionated aspect, Ploigos provides a number of predefined Steps, 
StepImplementers, and several CI/CD Workflows.

= Idea Delivery Workflow

Ploigos defines a reference high level workflow that covers the process of
taking the genesis of an idea, idea development, integration, and review. In
this high level rendering of the {ProjectName} workflow, the majority of
steps are _Predefined Procedures_. These procedures are placeholders for more
complex sub workflows containing multiple Procedures, the details of which
are defined in later sections. This simplification allows for a 'one slide'
view of the workflow.

== Idea Delivery Workflow Steps

Each predefined process represents an encapsulation of steps that are
typically necessary in a complete end-to-end pipeline

Prioritize Ideas:: New ideas are placed in a work management tool, refined,
and prioritized. The work management tool allows for organization and
tracking of ideas as they move through the workflow. Steps will vary based
on existing organizational structure and specific tool chosen, but basic
requirements involve being able to: record new ideas, backlog management,
assign ideas to developers, and track progress and status.

Development:: The development procedure where an idea is implemented in
software. This includes an isolated development environment for developer
to begin coding.

Create or Update Merge Request to Release Branch:: The procedure for how merges
happen into the release branch in the source code repository. Deployment of
build artifacts into a temporary development environment that will occur when a
merge request is created (from a feature branch to the primary release branch),
and for any subsequent changes to the merging feature branch. Acceptance
of a merge request is automated, contingent on passing all gates defined
in the CI/CD pipeline for the merging branch, and passing all gates of the
CI/CD pipeline after the merge into the primary branch is complete.

Detect Change:: The procedure for detecting change in the source code
repository, and using that event to initiate appropriate action in the CI/CD
procedure. The event can be a change in a feature branch, release branch,
a new merge request, etc.

CI/CD:: Build artifacts are created and tested automatically on a continual
basis. This provides developers with the ability to make code changes
with instant (real-time) deployment of those changes into live development
runtime environment. An ability to bypass pipeline to reduce friction during
development on feature branches.  The detailed CI/CD Process Workflow section
provides more details on this predefined process.

Retrospective:: An introspection of the processes used by the team to
deliver the software to evaluate the effectiveness of the overall process
itself. Allows for modifying a predefined procedure or even modifying the
Idea Delivery Workflow itself based on team feedback.

Peer Review:: Collaborate with others in the process of reviewing code in
order to make sure it works, the code conforms to organizational coding
standards, and in order to improve the code where possible.

* Mark Merge Request as Work In Progress (WIP)
* Peer Review
* Merge to Release Branch 
* Delete MR#-DEV Deployment Environment

Release:: Predefined process for how software is released.

= CI/CD Process Workflow

The CI/CD Process Workflow is broken down into 3 broad categories:

Minimal Workflow:: Implements the fewest number of tools possible to still be
considered a CI/CD pipeline. This workflow is recommended for demo 
presentations, and initial proof of concept evaluations.

Typical Workflow:: This workflow represents a typical CI/CD pipeline that
provides a standard tool suite and features that are commonly found in modern
CI/CD pipelines. Most workflows will start with the Typical Workflow as a
baseline.

Everything Workflow:: A workflow that uses all possible capabilities of
currently implemented steps in Ploigos. This workflow is used to showcase all
capabilities and for application development that requires stringent security
and testing capabilities that are not usually found in the Typical Workflow

Each workflow type at minimum follows the process below and only differs in the
specific steps in the Setup, Continuous Integration(CI), and Continuous 
Deployment(CD) stages.

[id="{ProjectNameID}-workflow-components-processes-level-{context}"]

Setup::

Initial setup of the CI/CD pipeline. This step includes deployment and
configuration of a pipeline using Ploigos

Continuous Integration::

Development work that happens on the deployed CI/CD pipeline

Continuous Deployment - DEV::

Deployment of the application into a development environment for the developer
to review

Continuous Deployment - TEST::

Deployment of the application into the testing environment for functionality,
performance, and acceptance testing.

Continuous Deployment - PROD::

Deployment of the application into the production environment.

== Detailed Workflow Step Descriptions

Detect Change::
 - Detect new/changed/merged branches[[detect-detect]]

  To bring an idea from development into a release (and ultimately production)
  a developer will create a merge request from feature branch to the primary 
  release branch. The merge request should initially be created as WIP, which 
  indicates this is a "Work in progress" and not yet ready to be merged. The act 
  of creating the merge request from a feature branch to the release branch 
  should trigger the pipeline to be run on the new feature branch.

 - Start CI/CD Workflow for Changed Branch[[detect-start]]

  The capability of the CI tool to detect actions at the source control tool. 
  For actions "new merge request" or "changed merge request", the pipeline will
  run and the subject will be feature branch being merged. For "merge of 
  feature branch to release branch" the pipeline will run and the subject will 
  be the primary release branch.

Setup::
 - Setup Workflow StepRunner[[setup-steprunner]]

  
 - Setup PGP Keys[[setup-pgpkeys]]

 Generate or import PGP keys that will be later used to cryptographically
 sign container images and/or attestations.

Continuous Integration::
 - Generate Metadata[[ci-metadata]]

 The pipeline will generate a semantic version based on other metadata,
 to produce version and image tag to uniquely identify artifacts associated
 with the pipeline run. This information gets applied to runtime artifacts
 and container image as labels.

 - Tag Source Code[[ci-tagsource]]

 This step will take the version created in the "Generate Metadata" step to
 tag the source in source control.

 - Run Unit Tests[[ci-unittest]]

 Validate that each module of the software performs as designed.

 - Package Application Artifact[[ci-packageart]]

 Build runtime artifacts, distribution archives, and other necessary artifacts
 required to run application.

 - Run Static Code Analysis[[ci-staticcode]]

 The pipeline will perform static analysis on source code to identify
 defects, vulnerabilities, programmatic and stylistic problems as early in
 the development life cycle as possible. For example, static analysis is
 completed prior to building, scanning and deploying the image.

 - Push Application Artifact to Repository[[ci-pushart]]

 Transfer runtime artifacts into a centralized artifact repository for
 distribution.

 - Create Container Image[[ci-buildimg]]

 Assemble the minimal container image that the application will need to run,
 including the packaged application artifacts. Test container images, verify
 functionality, and validate the structure and content of the container
 themselves.

 - Run Static Image Scan: Compliance[[ci-staticimage-comp]]

 Ensure adherence to an organization's security compliance policy by your
 container image.

 - Run Static Image Scan: Vulnerability[[ci-staticimage-vuln]]

 Identify software vulnerabilities in your container image.

 - Push Container Image to Repository[[ci-pushimg]]
 
 Transfer the verified image to centralized repository with metadata applied
 as labels to the image.
 
 - Sign Container Image[[ci-signimg]]

 Sign the container image to allow validating image source and ensure image has
 not been tampered with.

 - Generate, Publish, and Sign Evidence[[ci-attest]]

 Generates, publishes, and signs evidence output by all previous steps up to 
 this point. Used later for attestation gates.


Continuous Deployment::
 - Audit Attestation[[cd-audit]]

 Evaluates the evidence generated up to this point against a given set of 
 attestations.

 - Deploy or Update to DEV Environment[[cd-deploy-dev]]

 Provide a temporary environment for deployment of code changes associated with
 a feature. If the environment does not already exist, the environment will
 be created.  The lifetime of the environment is limited to the time it takes
 to implement the feature and merge the changes into the release branch of the
 primary code repository. At which point the development environment will 
 be deleted.

 - Deploy or Update to TEST Environment[[cd-deploy-test]]

 Deploy image built from the latest release branch to the test environment.

 - Deploy or Update to PROD Environment[[cd-deploy-prod]]

 Deploy tested application to shared production environment with latest feature
 available to end users.

 - Validate Environment Configuration[[cd-validate]]

 To validate the environment matches a given baseline of required objects, and
 configuration of those objects are correct. Requirements for this step can 
 often come from an enterprise security and compliance team.

 - Run User Acceptance Tests(UAT)[[cd-uat]]

 Assess if the system can support day-to-day business and user scenarios
 and ensure the system is sufficient and correct for business usage.

 - Run Performance Tests (limited)[[cd-perf-limited]]

 Evaluates the evidence generated up to this point against a given set of 
 attestations.

 - Run Performance Tests (full)[[cd-perf-full]]

 To identify and eliminate the performance bottlenecks in the application.

 - Run Canary Testing[[cd-canary]]

 Allows you to roll out new code/features to a subset of end-users as an 
 initial test.

 - Generate, Publish, and Sign Evidence[[cd-attest]]

 Generates, publishes, and signs evidence output by all previous steps up to 
 this point. Used later for attestation gates.

Report::
 - Generate and Publish Workflow Report[[report-gen]]

 Provide central dashboard with published test results as an indicator of 
 overall health of system

While the rendered PNGs here are useful for starting the conversation and
stating clearly the opinionated {ProjectName} workflow, it is recognized that
every implementation of the {ProjectName} will be different. This includes the
tool abstracted workflow, as well as the specific tools used to implement it.

To facilitate ease of adoption, consistency, reuse, and
contribution back to the community, the workflows are all drawn
