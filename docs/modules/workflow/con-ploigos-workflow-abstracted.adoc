_What is Ploigos?_

Ploigos is an opinionated workflow used to transform ideas into delivered software in a production environment. Ploigos can be divided into two major components: the Idea Delivery Workflow and the CI/CD Workflow.

The Idea Delivery Workflow is an abstract process workflow that defines a high level view of how an organization can best take ideas that solve business problems and implement the solution in a well defined procedure. This process focuses on the specific actions that need to take place without identifying specific tools for each step. Ploigos provides a general use Idea Delivery Workflow that can be further customized to fit specific projects as needed. A workflow first approach identifies the organizational behaviors and expected outcomes to define what quality is.  The workflow codifies and enforces these to ensure all aspects of security, compliance, trust, and privacy are addressed.

The CI/CD Workflow is the implementation of the software development portion of the Idea Delivery Workflow. Ploigos creates a framework for a modular, extensible, and opinionated CD/CD pipeline. Modularity and extensibility are accomplished by defining one or more '*Steps*' in the CD/CD workflow, and automating the *Step* by creating a *StepImplementer*. As part of fulfilling the opinionated aspect, Ploigos provides a number of pre-defined Steps, StepImplementers, and several CI/CD Workflows.

= Idea Delivery Workflow

Ploigos defines a reference high level workflow that covers the process of taking the genesis of an idea, idea development, integration, and review. In this high level rendering of the {ProjectName} workflow, the majority of steps are _Predefined Procedures_. These procedures are placeholders for more complex sub workflows containing multiple Procedures, the details of which are defined in later sections. This simplification allows for a 'one slide' view of the workflow.

== Idea Delivery Workflow Steps

Each predefined process represents an encapsulation of steps that are typically necessary in a complete end-to-end pipeline


Prioritize Ideas::
New ideas are placed in a work management tool, refined, and prioritized. The work management tool allows for organization and tracking of ideas as they move through the workflow. Steps will vary based on existing organizational structure and specific tool chosen, but basic requirements involve being able to: record new ideas, backlog management, assign ideas to developers, and track progress and status.

Development::
The development procedure where an idea is implemented in software. This includes an isolated development environment for developer to begin coding.

Create or Update Merge Request to Release Branch::
The procedure for how merges happen into the release branch in the source code repository. Deployment of build artifacts into a temporary development environment that will occur when a merge request is created (from a feature branch to the primary release branch), and for any subsequent changes to the merging feature branch. Acceptance of a merge request is automated, contingent on passing all gates defined in the CI/CD pipeline for the merging branch, and passing all gates of the CI/CD pipeline after the merge into the primary branch is complete.

Detect Change::
The procedure for detecting change in the source code repository, and using that event to initiate appropriate action in the CI/CD procedure. The event can be a change in a feature branch, release branch, a new merge request, etc.


CI/CD::
Build artifacts are created and tested automatically on a continual basis. This provides developers with the ability to make code changes with instant (realtime) deployment of those changes into live development runtime environment. An ability to bypass pipeline to reduce friction during development on feature branches.
The detailed CI/CD Process Workflow section provides more details on this predefined process.

Retrospective::
An introspection of the processes used by the team to deliver the software to evaluate the effectiveness of the overall process itself. Allows for modifying a predefined procedure or even modifying the Idea Delivery Workflow itself based on team feedback.

Peer Review::
Collaborate with others in the process of reviewing code in order to make sure it works, the code conforms to organizational coding standards, and in order to improve the code where possible.

* Mark Merge Request as Work In Progress (WIP)
* Peer Review
* Merge to Release Branch
* Delete MR#-DEV Deployment Environment



Release::
Predefined process for how software is released.

== Minimum Workflow Steps

Detect Change::
 - Detect new/changed/merged branches

 To bring an idea from development into a release (and ultimately production) a developer will create a merge request from feature branch to the primary release branch. The merge request should initially be created as WIP, which indicates this is a "Work in progress" and not yet ready to be merged. The act of creating the merge request from a feature branch to the release branch should trigger the pipeline to be run on the new feature branch.


 - Start CI/CD workflow for changed branch

 The capability of the CI tool to detect actions at the source control tool. For actions "new merge request" or "changed merge request", the pipeline will run and the subject will be feature branch being merged. For "merge of feature branch to release branch" the pipeline will run and the subject will be the primary release branch.

Setup::
 - Setup workflow step runner
 - Setup PGP keys

Continuous Integration::
 - Generate metadata

  The pipeline will generate a semantic version based on other metadata, to produce version and image tag to uniquely identify artifacts associated with the pipeline run. This information gets applied to runtime artifacts and container image as labels.

 - Tag Source Code

  This step will take the version created in the "generate metadata" step to tag the source in source control.

 - Package Application Artifact

  Build runtime artifacts, distribution archives, and other necessary artifacts required to run application.

 - Push Application Artifact to repository

  Transfer runtime artifacts into a centralized artifact repository for distribution.

 - Create Container Image
 - Push container image to registry

Continuous Deployment - DEV (Feature Branch)::
 - Deploy or Update to dev environment

 Provide a temporary environment for deployment of code changes associated with a feature. If the environment does not already exist, the environment will be created.  The lifetime of the environment is limited to the time it takes to implement the feature and merge the changes into the release branch of the primary code repo. At which point the development environment will be deleted.

Continuous Deployment - TEST (Release Branch)::
 - Deploy or Update to test environment

 Deploy image built from the latest release branch to the test environment.

Continuous Deployment - PROD (Release Branch)::
 - Deploy or Update to production environment

 Deploy tested code to shared prod environment with latest feature available to end users

Report::
 - Generate and publish workflow report

 Provide central dashboard with published test results as an indicator of overall health of system
