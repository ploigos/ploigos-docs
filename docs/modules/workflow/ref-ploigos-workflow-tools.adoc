= Ploigos Workflow Tools

Once a Idea Delivery Workflow and CI/CD Process Workflow is established,
then the next task is to determine all of the types of components needed to 
implement the workflow. This is done by ensuring each of the required
tool categories in the table below are being tracked as an item that is either
deployed or provided by a 3rd party.

Finally, choosing the actual component implementers (meaning the specific 
software tools or products) can be performed. This section has components that
are dictated by the established Idea Delivery Workflow, CI/CD Process Workflow,
and the tool categories. Some of the categories below may be optional depending
on the workflow.
