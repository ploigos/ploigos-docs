= {ProjectName} Workflow Tools

Once a <<{ProjectNameID}-workflow-{context}>> is decided upon, then the next task is to determine all of the types of components needed to implement the workflow, and then finally, the actual component implementers (aka, specific technology implementations and tools). This section contains both the component types and their purposes as well as opinions on which actual component implementations to use to fullfil the required components needs.
