= Changing the Workflow

Forking the StepRunner and Jenkins Library::

In order to customize the CI/CD workflow and how specific steps in that
workflow are configured, the first step is to clone and modify the source
code repositories that control the workflow operation. With Ploigos this
will be the `ploigos-jenkins-library` and `ploigos-step-runner` repositories.

In the following example, it will be demonstrated how to fork the official
`ploigos-step-runner` and `ploigos-jenkins-library` repositories to the Gitea
server hosted as part of the CI/CD Workflow, and update the reference
application to use the forked repositories.


. Create the empty/bank repositories in Gitea with the following names:
  
  ploigos-step-runner
  ploigos-jenkins-library

. Clone the repositories:

  git clone https://github.com/ploigos/ploigos-step-runner.git
  git clone https://github.com/ploigos/ploigos-jenkins-library

. Update the cloned repository remote to point to the Gitea server
  
  cd ploigos-jenkins-library
  git remote rename origin github
  git remote add origin https://<repo_url>/platform/ploigos-jenkins-library.git
  git push -u origin main
  git push --tags

  cd ploigos-step-runner
  git remote rename origin github
  git remote add origin https://<repo_url>/platform/ploigos-step-runner.git
  git push -u origin main
  git push --tags


. Configure the Jenkinsfile for the reference application 
  to point to the new internal `ploigos-step-runner` (if using the Software
  Factory Operator and the `mvn-reference-app` application)

Creating or Updating the Workflow::

Changes to the Ploigos CI/CD Workflow start in the `ploigos-jenkins-library` 
repository. The repository container a *vars/* directory which defines the 3
common CI/CD workflows:

* *ploigosWorkflowMinimal.groovy* - Minimum Jenkins workflow
* *ploigosWorkflowTypical.groovy* - Typical Jenkins workflow (Recommended)
* *ploigosWorkflowEverything.groovy* - Jenkins workflow with all options 
  enabled

Each groovy file is split into two primary sections: the *WorkflowParams*
which contains variables for the workflow that can be set in the application
Jenkinsfile, and the following section which defines the Jenkins *pipeline*

When creating new pipelines, ensure that it contains at least the following stages:

* *SETUP: Workflow Step Runner*: this stage prepares the PGP keys for use 
across all subsequent steps, and updates the Ploigos Step Runner if needed.
* *CI: Generate Metadata*: this stage gathers information about the git 
repository that this workflow is being run against, as well as any metadata 
that would be relevant for upcoming steps (e.g., information from the POM file
if this is a Maven build).
* *CI: Tag Source Code*: this stage tags the current commit and pushes it to 
the git repo, allowing for traceability between code commits and the CI/CD 
workflow results.
* The reporting step (defined under *pipeline.post.always*) should be part of 
every workflow.

For the new workflow, identify which environments will have deployments
(DEV/TEST/PROD) and ensure each environment has a *stage('<ENV>')* entry
defined. Substages under the *stage(Continuous Integration)* definition
can be customized to match the planned CI/CD Workflow.

Before removing the definition for a stage, take note of all variables that 
are being used. If these variables are not used anywhere else in the file, the 
variable declaration at the top of the file should be removed. While all 
variables should be examined, the following are the main variables to watch 
out for:

* *WORKFLOW_WORKER_**: these variables are used in the container() declaration.
Note that if a container is no longer used, its associated entry in 
*spec.containers* entry can be removed as well.
* *envName**: if any of the deployment steps are being removed, the associated 
variable for environment name (e.g., *envNameProd*) can be removed.
* *releaseGitRefPatterns*: this variable is used in every deployment step; if 
every deployment step is removed, this variable can be removed as well.
