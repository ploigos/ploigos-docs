= Tool Abstracted Workflow

When discussing methods for getting ideas from peoples' heads to production, groups often get lost in talking about technology and tools and avoid the hard work of deciding on the abstract process, or workflow. This section has pictorial renderings of the {ProjectShortName} opinionated workflow in an abstract form, that is without any specific technologies or tools. The intent being this can be used as a primer for a team to first discuss and decide on their own specific {ProjectShortName} workflow, and then use the provided templates to draw it to avoid the https://www.jpattonassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/glad-we-all-agree-1.png["I'm glad we all agree"] problem that enviably arrases if an abstract concept is not concretely defined by drawing it.

== High Level

A high level rendering of the {ProjectShortName} workflow where the majority of steps are Predefined Procedures. That is, they are placeholders for more complex sub workflows containing multiple Procedures, the details of which are defined in <<{ProjectNameID}-tool-abstracted-workflow-detailed>>. If something is needed that will fit on "one slide" this is it.

[id="{ProjectNameID}-tool-abstracted-workflow-detailed", reftext="{ProjectShortName} Tool Abstracted Workflow - Detailed"]
== Detailed

If there is one artifact that defines what the {ProjectShortName} is, this is it. This is the detailed opinionated workflow for delivering "ideas to production" as defined by and implemented by the {ProjectShortName}.

While the rendered PNGs here are useful for starting the conversation and stating clearly the opinionated {ProjectShortName} workflow, it is recognized that every implementation of the {ProjectShortName} will be different. This includes the tool abstracted workflow, as well as the specific tools used to implement it.

To facilitate ease of adoption, consistency, re-use, and contribution back to the community, the workflows are all drawn in the https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/[MXGraph] format using https://draw.io/[Draw.io] and provided here for consumption, modification, and re-use.
