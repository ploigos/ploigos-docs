= Tool Abstracted Workflow

As a derivative of the Trusted Software Supply Chain, infrastructure as code development and delivery/deployment is akin to software development. Instead of treating your enterprise infrastructure as unique or bespoke implementations, they can be viewed as immutable or standardized building blocks expressed in human readable "code".

Traditionally, system administrators and engineers craft information systems by hand and collate details into documentation which is handed off to another human actor to perform its implementation; This process risks error and inconsistency to the delivery cycle and increases the amount of time it takes to get a new system into production environments.

By adopting traditional software development conventions and workflows, breaking down vertical labor silos and creating teams with diverse member composition across the enterprise, you increase end to end accountability and introduce the "DevOps" culture or method of operating. The details defined in this section cover some of the tools within the supply chain needed to perform this infrastructure as code development controlled by those processes.

== High Level

A high level rendering of the {ProjectShortName} workflow where the majority of steps are Predefined Procedures. That is, they are placeholders for more complex sub workflows containing multiple Procedures, the details of which are defined in <<{ProjectNameID}-tool-abstracted-workflow-detailed>>. If something is needed that will fit on "one slide" this is it.

== Detailed

If there is one artifact that defines what the {ProjectShortName} is, this is it. This is the detailed opinionated workflow for delivering infrastructure as code as defined by and implemented by the {ProjectShortName}.

While the rendered images here are useful for starting the conversation and stating clearly the opinionated {ProjectShortName} workflow, it is recognized that every implementation of the {ProjectShortName} will be different. This includes the tool abstracted workflow, as well as the specific tools used to implement it.

To facilitate ease of adoption, consistency, re-use, and contribution back to the community, the workflows are all drawn in the https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/[MXGraph] format using https://draw.io/[Draw.io] and provided here for consumption, modification, and re-use.
